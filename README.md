# regex_matcher
This repo has a quick and dirty implementation of a regular-expression matcher in spacy. This class has the same behavior as the spacy `Matcher` and `PhraseMatcher`, but operates over the underlying text rather than individual tokens (unlike `Matcher`) and allows regular expression syntax (unlike `Phrasematcher`).
